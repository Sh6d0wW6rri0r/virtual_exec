# VE
Virtual Exec, also called VE is a Virtual Machine environment, coded in C++.. it should compile on all Unix / Linux platform, but the current Makefile is only for Mac OS X.
The idea behind this project is to create a Virtual Machine which can federate multiple computer resources rather than working on only one computer.
This project is more centered on building the framework or toolbox in order each user can build its own Devices, Memory cards, Processor and the library takes care of all the backend.
This project is released as opensource under the GNU Public License.
